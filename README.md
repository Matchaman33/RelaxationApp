AP Computer Science Relaxation App

This project was submitted as my AP Computer Science Project. The goal of the project was to "incorporate an algorithm"
into an application that would be useful.

Project notes

* This App uses html, css, php, json, and javascript
* The App uses 2 frameworks Bootstrap and particle.js
* Bootstrap: https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/

HOW TO RUN MY PROJECT
/**

* The start of the website should be opened with index.html in the root directory.  
* This project requires a server to run (i.e Xampp).
* It would be best to run this app with google chrome.
